# Assignment-1
Project Name: Wei Xiang's Portfolio

The purpose of this website is to present myself in the best light by displaying my achievements, 
experiences, skills and more.

The website is catering for my achievements, experiences, future goals, skills and more. The 
information provided in this website would be sufficient for my employers to decide whether 
they want to hire me.

## Design Process
This website is intended for employers, who are considering to hire me, to look through my
portfolio. This allows the employers to clearly know my capabilities and decide whether I am
the person that they are finding for.

I designed the website either by putting an image beside a paragraph of text or arrange all the paragraphs together, then arrange the images together. I chose to do it this way as I see that a lot in many other websites, so I felt that it is the standard way to do it. Furthermore, I also feel that it looks very neat and organised as there is a structure. I also tried to align everything to the centre as much as possible, so that it would look aesthetically more pleasing and also more organised.

For my home page, I decided to include a large image before my title and introduction as I feel that it would be good to let an image give a general idea and impression of my website. I also feel that it would be more unique and special as compared to just starting off with a title, which sometimes can be quite plain and boring. Furthermore, I thought that this image would make my website more aesthetic.

As the designer of the website, I want employers to be appealed to my website, so that they will have a good first impression on me, which may give me a better chance to get hired.

## Features
One feature that I have included for each page is the Contact Me section. Since this website is to showcase my portfolio, I thought that it would be a good idea to leave my contacts to the employers looking at my portfolio. This would make it easier for employers to contact me if they are interested in hiring me.

Another feature that I have included for each page is the "Previous Page" and "Next Page" buttons. This is to ensure that employers that are going through my website can have a smooth transition between pages. 

I also added a navigation bar so that employers that visit my website can have an easier way to go through my pages. It also states the content of my entire portfolio, which can be a useful feature. If employers are only interested in my projects and work, then they can directly navigate to the next page, which can save them time and effort.


### Existing Features
Contact Me.
"Previous Page", "Next Page" or "Home Page" buttons. Allows users to have smooth transition between pages.

Hero Image for the beginning of each page. Aesthetically more pleasing and pleasant.

Navigation bar. More convenient, allows users to navigate to specific pages quickly.


### Features Left to Implement
Hire Me button that brings users to a form.


## Technologies Used
I also used flexboxes to organise my images so that they do not look messy or in a wrong postition.
I used hero images as background image for my headings to make my website look more aesthetically pleasing.


## Testing
At first, I did not have the meta viewport in my head of the html files, which resulted in some problems when I tried to view the website on mobile version. After I added the viewport, another problem arised. I realised that the content was floating more towards the left side of the webpage. Hence, I changed the initial scale of the viewport, which managed to solve the issue I was having.

Flexboxes took me a lot of testing and experimenting to do. Sometimes, even if I chose the values that are suppose work, such as making 2 images side by side with equal distance from the side borders of the webpage, the images do not seem to be where they should be. I have to make many adjustments, such as justify-content and also adding borders so that I can see the flexboxes and deleting them afterwards.

Hero Images at the start of each page also did not work well as expected at first. The picture was not being displayed as the background image, even though I have set that in the hero-image class. I had to do more researching and spend more time and effort to figure out what was wrong and eventually finding a solution to it. I had to change the height of the body and html and also setting the margin to 0.

Top navigation menu was also very time-consuming. I had to do research on how to make the navigation buttons equal lengths so that they will fit perfectly across the webpage. Designing and laying out the text in the buttons were rather easy. However, some problems arised. Even though the values I set for the buttons were supposedly equally positioned across the webpage, there was a small space at the end of the navigation menu, which was very obvious and unprofessional. Hence, I had to adjust the padding and the width of the buttons so that the problem would be solved. Eventually, the problem was solved, but it took a lot of time, which could be spent on improving other parts of the website.

## Credits
I used google for the images of the HTML. Links to the images are below.
