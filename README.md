Project Name: Wei Xiang's Portfolio
The purpose of this website is to present myself in the best light by displaying my achievements, 
experiences, skills and more.

This website is intended for employers, who are considering to hire me, to look through my
portfolio. This allows the employers to clearly know my capabilities and decide whether I am
the person that they are finding for.

The website is catering for my achievements, experiences, future goals, skills and more. The 
information provided in this website would be sufficient for my employers to decide whether 
they want to hire me.

## Design Process
I designed the website either by putting an image beside a paragraph of text or arrange all the  paragraphs together, then arrange the images together. I chose to do it this way as I see that 
a lot in many other websites, so I felt that it is the standard way to do it. Furthermore, I also feel that it looks very neat and organised as there is a structure. I also tried to align everything to the centre as much as possible, so that it would look aesthetically more pleasing and also more organised.

For my home page, I decided to include a large image before my title and introduction as I feel
that it would be good to let an image give a general idea and impression of my website. I also 
feel that it would be more unique and special as compared to just starting off with a title, which
sometimes can be quite plain and boring. Furthermore, I thought that this image would make my website more aesthetic.
