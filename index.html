Through the responsibilities given to him, he developed respect, diligence, resilience and responsibility. Wei Xiang also learned to respond to critical situations quickly and calmly. As the chairperson of Media Resource, he worked hard to motivate his team members to excel.
            As a further testimonial to his contributions to the school, he participated in a science competition, "Amaning Science X-Challenge" in 2016. He represented the school and competed with teams from other schools. Though he did not win this competition, he discovered the importance of hard work and to always strive for the best. In class, Wei Xiang helped to set up the projector and sound system from 2016 to 2019. His role in the class played a vital role in helping the teachers to teach more efficiently 
            and effectively. Weixiang was a well-mannered boy. He demonstrated integrity and was friendly, helpful, humble and respectful. He was a reliable and trustworthy student leader.
