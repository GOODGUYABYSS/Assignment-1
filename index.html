        <h2>Educational History and Work Experiences</h2>
            <p class="opensans">
                I studied at Geylang Methodist School (Primary) and Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) and currently I am studying at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Immersive Media.
                Completed PSLE and O levels.
                My first work experience was during the long holidays after I finished my O levels.
                I decided to give it a try to work at a restaurant, doing things such as cleaning the tables, mopping and sweeping the floors, serving food and more.
                It was a very good experience as I was able to understand how the real world works.
                I also had some opportunities to solve some real-world problems, such as dealing with the customers unreasonable needs.
                I have also worked at Riot Games as a VFX artist when I was sent there to work as an intern.
                I was also part of the programming team for the projects they were having.
