            <h2>Skillsets</h2>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
                    I have learnt how to use Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Maya, Blender, Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Atom, Adobe Substance Painter, Adobe XD, Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint, Microsoft Excel. 
                    Some programming languages I have learnt are Python, JavaScript, C++, C+. 
                    I have also learnt HTML and CSS. 
                    I am able to speak 4 languages, English, Mandarin, French, Malay.
                    I am also good at problem-solving and capable of making decisions even under tough conditions. 
                    I am also good at working with people and doing projects together.
                    I am also a good leader when I have to step up to take the lead.
                    I am a very organised person myself and so I like to make sure everything has a procedure, and prioritising what comes first is very important to me.

            <h2>Other Interests</h2>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
                    Some interests I have are sports such as basketball, badminton, table tennis and jogging.
                    I love gaming as well.
                    Some games that I have played are CSGO, Valorant, Robocraft, League of Legends and PUBG.
                    I am also interested in learning to do more things with the programming languages that I have learnt.
                    I am still trying to do more things with python such as automating things and making PyGames.
                    I wish to be able to start up more projects during my free time and add them to my portfolio.
